When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
When I want to collaborate with many people. Also, when I know I may have t work on different devices and hence, I'd like my code to be
properly synced.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
When I have to be stingy with my datacard? Idk.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork - When I want to contribute to somebody else's project but I don't have permissions to make changes to his/her work.
Clone - When I want to transfer a repo from GitHub to my local computer 
Branch - When I want to add a new feature, try something new, or experiment.
