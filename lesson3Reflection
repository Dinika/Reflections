When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
When I want to collaborate with many people. Also, when I know I may have t work on different devices and hence, I'd like my code to be
properly synced.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
When I have to be stingy with my datacard? Idk.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork - When I want to contribute to somebody else's project but I don't have permissions to make changes to his/her work.
Clone - When I want to transfer a repo from GitHub to my local computer 
Branch - When I want to add a new feature, try something new, or experiment.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
We can do a git diff and resolve the conflicts.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Maybe I'll share my local repo with my collaborates through dropbox/google drive/one drive or the likes of these. I guess the fact that I wouldn't have to learn and worry about all these commands and concepts would be a plus, but I'm not sure that'd be enough for me to not use Git and GitHub. I'll probably end up with way too many zip files of different versions of my project on my laptop and cloud account, it'll be different to keep track of all the changes manually now that I know the GitHub way, and I can't imagine what a nightmare merging the changes would be.
